This event brings Veigue's neighbors, Monica and Steve, together, and if you make it to the end, you will receive the weapon [Volsung] for Veigue. This is a sub-event that can easily be missed, so be careful when it the different parts unlocks. The most problematic is the timing of the second and third visits to the Weapon shop. The second visit requires Claire (with Agathe inside), and the third visit requires Agathe (with Claire inside). In the third case, if Veigue goes out of control, Claire will leave the party, so you must go to Sulz before she does so.

▲ Without Claire, the conversation with Steve would progress, but the conversation with Monica would not.

The Factory Manager asks you to help him solve the mystery of a mysterious phenomenon that is occurring in the factory. The investigation will lead to the collection of the original pieces of a brooch that will serve as the key to open a locked door in the factory. There are many steps to the process, so please refer to the flow chart. Be careful, because if you collect the wrong pieces, you will have to start all over again from the beginning.

When half-way through the Climber's Cavern, a Gajuma woman is stranded. Talking to her will trigger the event, so follow the step-by-step below. In the Climber's Caverns, combats will be triggered just by touching the smoke, but at this point your party should be strong enough to win easily. The [Holy Bottle] is ineffective, so proceed steadily while defeating the enemies. After receiving the [Nakako Ore] from the Iron Factory manager in Petnadjanka, go to Tytree and talk to the factory manager. It's not connected to the event, but you will know why Tytree knew about the [Nakako Ore].

| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Reward-informational?style=for-the-badge&color=lightgray)   | Annie's Rod [Andalusite] |

The event in which Hack, who you repeatedly rescue, gives Annie her Rod, the [Andalusite] as a token of his appreciation. The locations and timing of these events are shown in the table below. If you see Hack after rescuing him, you can receive the weapon at any of the times shown in the table below. However, you can only receive the weapon once. After the second time, you will be asked if you have the weapon in your possession. No matter how you answer the question, it will not affect your future progress, and there is no need to keep the Andalusite itself. Even if it's a gift, you can inherit it onto another weapon.

| Location  | Timeline                     |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Balka   | From the rescue from Mesechina Caverns until the completion of the trial of Eephon.          |

| Mesechina Cavern | Any time other than the above three periods, except after the appearance of Yuris's realm.         |

▲After Yuris's Realm appears, you will not be able to trigger the event. Get the Rod as early as possible.

## Side-Quest #009 - The Stele in Mesechina Caverns

| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Reward-informational?style=for-the-badge&color=lightgray)   | — |

After Veigue and his team found the Stele in Mesechina Caverns, Hack was assigned to decipher it. As time goes by, the decipherment progresses and the content gradually gets closer to the heart of the matter. The timing of the changes is shown in the table below, so it is a good idea to stop by from time to time and ask Hack about the contents. Be especially careful during Chapter 47, as it is a very short period of time. If Hack is not in the cave, a note will be left for you. The contents of the decipherment are written in the note, so check the Stele.

When you try to enter Callegea Castle, Walto passes by and a conversation event with Eugene occurs. This is one of those side-quests that is easy to miss if you are proceeding normally with the main story, since it is during the time when you are in Kyogen or Nolzen, and since the duration of the event is short.

![](rebirth_guide/sub010_2.png)  
▲When you come to the position in the screenshot, the event begins. Note that it is not in front of Callegea Castle, where you get off the train.

▲Eugene does not explain himself to Walto. As the story progresses, we will know why.
