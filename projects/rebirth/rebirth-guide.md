This event brings Veigue's neighbors, Monica and Steve, together, and if you make it to the end, you will receive the weapon [Volsung] for Veigue. This is a sub-event that can easily be missed, so be careful when it the different parts unlocks. The most problematic is the timing of the second and third visits to the Weapon shop. The second visit requires Claire (with Agathe inside), and the third visit requires Agathe (with Claire inside). In the third case, if Veigue goes out of control, Claire will leave the party, so you must go to Sulz before she does so.
