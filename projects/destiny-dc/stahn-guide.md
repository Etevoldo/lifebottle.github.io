## Sub-event #003 - Soldier's Advance 1
Like the "Small Family" event mentioned above, this event also has multiple parts to enjoy. The first part occurs upon entering the Darilsheid pub through the front door. A rowdy Seingald soldier will try to put the moves on Rutee, but an uninterested Rutee immediately rejects him. The rest of the parts of this event have a limited duration for when you can see them, so be sure to check their availibilty so you don't miss any of them.

## Sub-event #004 - Country Boy
This event occurs when you encounter a man who seems to know Stahn in from of the Darilsheid Item shop. He is friendly and will ask Stahn if he knows him. You should answer honestly that you do not know him. Only the first answer will work, pretending to know the man will force you to Buy "Apple Gel" for 100 gald.

## Sub-event #005 - The Rumoured Seven Generals

## Sub-event #006 - Capsule Toy
There is a vending machine on the second floor of the Darilsheid Inn that offers capsule toys for 200 Gald.

## Sub-event #007 - Greedy Witch
In the plaza just after passing under Seingald Castle's gate, talk to the soldier and select "How about some manners!" to see this event. The soldier will try to recall Rutee's nickname in a comical scene featuring many overlaying messages. The soldier says many incorrect names, seemingly on purpose, and Rutee will question each one. After Rutee gets exhausted and dizzy, the soldier says her real nickname and abruptly walks away.

## Sub-event #008 - Doug Brothers
Between the period listed above (?), a sub-event will occur after heading to Reynold's Laboratory. There you will encounter Ashley of the Seven-Generals.
