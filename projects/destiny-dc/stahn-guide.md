This event occurs when you talk to the man in front of the inn in Janos. He tells you that he has been staying in Janos for several years without being able to return to Phandaria since he lost his passport. He begs you to sell him your passport, but of course you can't. This man also appears in "The Bird in the Cage" [Side-Quest #077](projects/destiny-dc/stahn-guide?id=Side-Quest-077-bird-in-a-cage).

This is a five part event and where each one is mandatory for the next one. The first one occurs when you examine the nest on the roof of the item shop. The shopkeeper will tell you that a family of birds that live on the roof and build a nest every year. The last part of this series of event will reward you with a [Magical Aroma], make sure to not miss any.

| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Reward-informational?style=for-the-badge&color=lightgray)   | None    |

Like the "Small Family" event mentioned above, this event also has multiple parts to enjoy. The first part occurs upon entering the Darilsheid bar through the front door. A rowdy Seingaldian soldier will try to put the moves on Rutee, but an uninterested Rutee immediately rejects him. The rest of the parts of this event have a limited duration for when you can see them, so be sure to check their availability so you don't miss any of them.

| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Reward-informational?style=for-the-badge&color=lightgray)   | Stahn's title [Country Boy]    |

This event occurs when you encounter a man who seems to know Stahn in from of the Darilsheid Item shop. He is friendly and will ask Stahn if he knows him. You should answer honestly that you do not know him. Only the first answer will work, pretending to know the man will force you to Buy [Apple Gel](projects/destiny-dc/items/item?id=item-apple-gel) for 100 gald.

The Heroes of Seinegald are known as the "Seven Generals." You will encounter rumors about them in various places. Once you have heard them all, head to the audience chamber within Seinegald Castle to witness an assembly of the Seven Generals. The locations where the rumors can be encountered are listed below.

| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Reward-informational?style=for-the-badge&color=lightgray)   | See table below    |

There is a vending machine on the second floor of the Darilsheid Inn that offers capsule items for 200 Gald. Some of the available items are rare, so if you have a few Gald to spare, you should try your luck! The following table shows the items that are available and the probability of obtaining them.

## Side-Quest #007 - Greedy Witch

  

|![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Location-informational?style=for-the-badge&color=lightgray) | Darilsheid   |

| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Reward-informational?style=for-the-badge&color=lightgray)   | Rutee's title [Greedy Witch]    |

In the plaza just after passing under Seingald Castle's gate, talk to the soldier and select "How about some manners!" to see this event. The soldier will try to recall Rutee's nickname in a comical scene featuring many overlapping messages. The soldier says many incorrect names, seemingly on purpose, and Rutee will question each one. After Rutee gets exhausted and dizzy, the soldier says her real nickname and abruptly walks away.



![](stahn-guide/sub007_1.png)  
▲ The [Greedy Witch] title is necessary to trigger Marian's Event [Side-Quest #097](projects/destiny-dc/stahn-guide?id=Side-Quest-097-Marian).

| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Reward-informational?style=for-the-badge&color=lightgray)   | None    |

Between the period listed above, a Side-Quest will occur uf you head to Reynold's Laboratory. There you will encounter Ashley of the Seven-Generals. He expresses frustration after learning of Stahn's mission and rushes off to the castle.



![](stahn-guide/sub008_1.png)  
▲ Triggering this Side-Quest is counterintuitive since it requires you to go back to the castle when you have no business there anymore the same is true for the "Alleged Mother"  [Side-Quest #010](projects/destiny-dc/stahn-guide?id=side-quest-010-alleged-mother).

## Side-Quest #009 - Bad Pun Man

| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------ |

| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Reward-informational?style=for-the-badge&color=lightgray)   | Mary's title [Breaker]    |

This event occurs after you visit Hugo's mansion in Darilsheid and receive the swordians. Speak with the old man in the house to the left in the residencial district. The old man, named "Bad Pun Man," shares that he loves puns, as long as they are of good caliber. Stahn impresses him, but Mary gives Stahn a hard time about his terrible jokes. Completing the event gives your the [Breaker] title for Mary.



![](stahn-guide/sub009_1.png)  
▲ You will need the [Breaker] title for the "Fayte" event [Side-Quest #081](projects/destiny-dc/stahn-guide?id=Side-Quest-081-Fayte).

## Side-Quest #010 - Alleged Mother?

| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Reward-informational?style=for-the-badge&color=lightgray)   | Mary's title [Home Cook]    |

This event only appears for a short time, so it's best to complete it PRIOR TO heading to Staylize Temple. Visit the dining room in Seinegald Castle, which is located at the end of the corridor on the left side of the first floor. A child will shout "mother," leading Stahn and the party to wonder for a moment if this child is Mary's. In the end, it all turns out to be a misunderstanding. 



![](stahn-guide/sub010_1.png)  
▲ The title for this Side-Quest is super important and you really need to get out of your way to get it since there's no reason to visit this room in the castle at this point.

## Side-Quest #011 - Draconis Crewman's Family 1

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Missable-informational?style=for-the-badge&color=red)   

|![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Location-informational?style=for-the-badge&color=lightgray) | Darilsheid   |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Timeline-informational?style=for-the-badge&color=lightgray) | No.09 Taking Hugo’s Request ~ No.37 End of part 1    |
| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Reward-informational?style=for-the-badge&color=lightgray)   | None    |

This event is available during the above period and occurs when you enter the two-story home behind the Darilsheid inn. Stahn and the party will encounter a mother scolding (?) her child as he pretends to be a member of the Draconis' crew. The woman shares with the party that her husband, who serves upon the Draconis, has yet to return. When Rutee attempts to tell the woman the fate of the Draconis, Leon intervenes. Leon (?) expresses concern for her husband's safety, but leaves without telling her about the crash. 



![](stahn-guide/sub011_1.png)  
▲ You can get the conclusion to this event in "Draconis Crewman's Family 2" [Side-Quest #124](projects/destiny-dc/stahn-guide?id=side-quest-124-draconis-crewman39s-family-2).

| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Reward-informational?style=for-the-badge&color=lightgray)   | None    |

The Dark Wings, whom you met in Janos, appear before Stahn and others once again in this Side-Quest. You trigger this event by visiting the plaza at the far side of Armeida. While this is the first of eight Side-Quests, there is no specific order in which to view the events staring these three "lens hunters." No items or titles are obtained either, but their antics are worth seeing through to the very end. 



![](stahn-guide/sub012_1.png)

## Side-Quest #013 - Lovers' Quarrels

Upon entering the grocery store in Armeida, Mary is informed that due to the laziness of the store owner's husband, the available ingredients leave much to be desired. Mary tries to offer advice to help them get the situation under control, but only time will tell if this will assist in replenishing the grocers shelves.

| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Reward-informational?style=for-the-badge&color=lightgray)   | Item [Life Bottle](projects/destiny-dc/items/item?id=item-life-bottle) x2    |

Visiting the plaza in Armedia during this you will encounter one the Seven Generals, General Lewein. Speaking to him will trigger an event where you learn about an unexpected connection between Stahn's grandfather, Thomas Aileron, and the General Lewein. 



![](stahn-guide/sub014_1.png)

## Side-Quest #015 - Philia's First Time in Junkland

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Missable-informational?style=for-the-badge&color=red)

| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Reward-informational?style=for-the-badge&color=lightgray)   | None    |

Junkland doesn't need to visited until towards the end of the story in case you just want to advance the main plot. However, to view this Side-Quest, you need to visit Junkland very early in the story. Near the armorer in Junkland, Philia is unable to handle the power stench in the air and falls ill. Do not fret - this event has no bearing on her actual status in game.



![](stahn-guide/sub015_1.png)  
▲ The best time to trigger this event is to go directly after leaving Cherik and before entering Calviola.

| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Reward-informational?style=for-the-badge&color=lightgray)   | None    |

To trigger this event, speak with a young boy with green hair near a large pool of water to the right of the entrance of Calviola. You will start the story of a boy named Toshu who has run away from home in order to join the Black Wings. The continuation of this story does not occur until this event is cleared. 



![](stahn-guide/sub016_1.png)  
▲ Toshu doesn't suspect the Dark Wings real identity. The second event will reveal what happened after that [Side-Quest #075](projects/destiny-dc/stahn-guide?id=Side-Quest-075-Yearning-to-join-the-Dark-Wings-2).

This event occurs when speaking with Elena, who is in a house to the left of the Oberon Corporation building in Valviola. She asks the party to assist her in finding her father, who is half Calviolan and half Seinegaldian. If you do not complete (trigger?) this Side-Quest, the second part, [Calviola's Elena 2], WILL NOT occur. 



![](stahn-guide/sub017_1.png)

This event occurs if you try to leave Calviola through the northern exit with lens. A boy bumps into Stahn and the others. Rutee immediately recognizes him as a lens pickpocket and presses him for answers. After a heated exchange, the boy eventually runs off with your lens. (?)

Visit the square close to where the Baruk Foundation(?) is located in Cherik to encounter the Black Wings. Approaching them causes an event to occur where they claim they are heros to the people of the city. However, they are ignored and are offered no fanfare. No matter what they try, they cannot grab the attention of anyone and are not taken seriously. 



![](stahn-guide/sub019_1.png)

Rutee shares her opinion that they are still siblings, even if they aren't related by blood.  The girl doesn't understand what Rutee says and leaves. You must complete this even before the next event, [Sibling 2], can occur. You have a very short window to complete these, so you should do both of them when you first visit Neustadt.
